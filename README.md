# ai-pong-game-2
A two player version of the classic Pong game, similar to air hockey.




Create a two player version of the classic Pong game, similar to air hockey. The blocks are located in the center, in the middle between the players. The user plays one user at the bottom of the screen and AI plays the other player from the top of the screen. Build this game with the Pixi.js library. For app UI, use React/TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS. Use Vite for app building. The AI should have a basic level of difficulty, making it possible for the user to win but still providing a challenge. The game should keep track of the score and display it on the screen. When a player scores a point, the game should reset the ball to the center of the screen and continue playing. The game should also have a start screen and a game over screen, allowing the user to restart the game or exit.
